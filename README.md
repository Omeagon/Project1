Project 1: Group 1 Project Proposal <<Eddie, Eric, Ross, & Steph>>

Our group is looking at using the Medical Appointment No Shows data set from Kaggle for the project <<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments/data>>. 

This project tasks are assigned as follows: 

Eddie:
•	What factors from among the following play a role in missed appointments? Which do not?  
  o Age
  o Gender
  o Neighborhood 

Eric: 
•	Do patients who answered positively to a conditional question show up at a different rate than those who did not? Conditionals including:
  o Hypertension
  o Diabetes
  o Alcaholism
  o Handicap
  
Steph:   
•	Length of time between scheduled appointment and appointment date vs % of people who showed up to the appointment
    o	Is there an optimal time to schedule an appointment so you do not miss it?
•	Is there a day of the week that has a higher volume of missed appointments?
•	Does the time of day that an appointment is scheduled impact the chances of the patient showing up?

Ross: 
•	Why do 30% of patients miss their scheduled appointments? 
    o	What factors cause this?
•	What impact does the SMS received play in missed appointments?
• PowerPoint Creation 
• Analysis write up 

Team: 
Based on findings:
  •	What steps can be taken by a company to predict/reduce the chance of a no show happening?
  •	Are there identifying factors that can be used to determine if someone is more or less likely to miss an appointment?
    o	Can this data be used by the scheduler to prevent multiple missed appointments in a day?
  •	What other assumptions or inferences can we conclude from this data?

***
* The group is aware that this information comes from Brazil in 2016.
* This data includes 110528 rows (-1 for column headers) and 14 columns.
* Due to the volume of information, we believe it is possible to draw reasonable conclusions from the data.
