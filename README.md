Project 1: Group 1 Project Proposal <<Eddie, Eric, Ross, & Steph>>

Our group is looking at using the Medical Appointment No Shows data set from Kaggle for the project <<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments/data>>. 

This project will attempt to answer the following using this dataset: 
  •	Why do 30% of patients miss their scheduled appointments? 
    o	What factors cause this?
  •	Length of time between scheduled appointment and appointment date vs % of people who showed up to the appointment
    o	Is there an optimal time to schedule an appointment so you do not miss it?
  •	Is there a day of the week that has a higher volume of missed appointments?
  •	Do factors like age, gender, etc. play a role in missed appointments?
  •	Does the time of day that an appointment is scheduled impact the chances of the patient showing up?
  •	What impact does the SMS received play in missed appointments?
  •	Do patients who answered positively to a conditional question show up at a different rate than those who did not?


Based on findings:
  •	What steps can be taken by a company to predict/reduce the chance of a no show happening?
  •	Are there identifying factors that can be used to determine if someone is more or less likely to miss an appointment?
    o	Can this data be used by the scheduler to prevent multiple missed appointments in a day?
  •	What other assumptions or inferences can we conclude from this data?

The group is aware that this information comes from Brazil in 2016. This data includes 110528 rows (-1 for column headers) and 14 columns.  Due to the volume of information, we believe it is possible to draw reasonable conclusions from the data.
