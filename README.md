# Project 1 Project Proposal

- Project 1: Group 1 Project Proposal <<Eddie, Eric, Ross, & Steph>>

- Our group is looking at using the Medical Appointment No Shows data set from Kaggle for the project <<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments/data>>. 

- This project tasks are assigned as follows: 

- Eddie:
- - What factors from among the following play a role in missed appointments? Which do not?  
    - Age
    - Gender
    - Neighborhood 

- Eric: 
  - Do patients who answered positively to a conditional question show up at a different rate than those who did not? Conditionals including:
    - Hypertension
    - Diabetes
    - Alcaholism
    - Handicap
  
- Steph:   
  - Length of time between scheduled appointment and appointment date vs % of people who showed up to the appointment
    - Is there an optimal time to schedule an appointment so you do not miss it?
  - Is there a day of the week that has a higher volume of missed appointments?
  - Does the time of day that an appointment is scheduled impact the chances of the patient showing up?

- Ross: 
  - Why do 30% of patients miss their scheduled appointments? 
    - What factors cause this?
  - What impact does the SMS received play in missed appointments?
  - PowerPoint Creation 
  - Analysis write up 

- Team: 
  - Based on findings:
    - What steps can be taken by a company to predict/reduce the chance of a no show happening?
    - Are there identifying factors that can be used to determine if someone is more or less likely to miss an appointment?
      - Can this data be used by the scheduler to prevent multiple missed appointments in a day?
    - What other assumptions or inferences can we conclude from this data?

***
- The group is aware that this information comes from Brazil in 2016.
- This data includes 110528 rows (-1 for column headers) and 14 columns.
- Due to the volume of information, we believe it is possible to draw reasonable conclusions from the data.
